# Milestone 3: Login System with OTP Verification 🔐

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this milestone was to implement a robust authentication and verification layer for the **FitPlan AI** application. To ensure a professional and secure user experience, the system now features database-backed credentials and mandatory 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) via Email OTP before granting access to the personalized fitness dashboard.

## 🛠️ Key Features Implemented
* **User Signup & Registration**: A dedicated Signup page allows new users to securely register their accounts using an Email ID and Password.
* **Database Management**: Integration of a backend database to securely store, retrieve, and verify user credentials and profile settings.
* **Professional Login Interface**: A sleek, split-screen Login page featuring a high-contrast design with a red-tinted gym background on the left and a clean white form on the right.
* **6-Digit OTP Generation**: Upon successful password verification, the system automatically generates a unique, time-sensitive 6-digit One-Time Password (OTP).
* **Automated Email Integration**: The generated OTP is instantly dispatched to the user's registered email address for identity verification.
* **OTP Verification Gate**: A secondary security page where users must enter the correct code to unlock access to their personalized fitness tools.
* **Restricted Dashboard Access**: The main application dashboard is strictly locked until the user successfully completes the OTP verification process.

## 📁 Repository Structure
The project is organized into a modular structure to handle authentication, multi-page navigation, and AI processing:

### Core Files
* **`app.py`**: The main entry point for the Streamlit application.
* **`auth_token.py`**: Handles security tokens and session management.
* **`model_api.py`**: Contains logic for querying the AI model for workout generation.
* **`prompt_builder.py`**: Logic to construct detailed 8-argument prompts for personalized plans.
* **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the application.
* **`Dockerfile`**: Configuration for containerized deployment.

### Multi-Page Dashboard (`/pages`)
* **`1_Profile.py`**: Handles Section 1 (User Details) and Section 2 (Goals & Equipment).
* **`2_Workout_Plan.py`**: Handles Section 3 (Generated 5-day output).
